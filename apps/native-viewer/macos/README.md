# macOS app

`build-app.sh FORMAT OUTPUT_DIR VERSION BUILD_VERSION` builds one of `docx`,
`xlsx`, or `pptx` for both architectures, merges it into a universal binary,
and assembles the matching BetterOffice app with its icon, native macOS shell,
and bundled shared editors. Launching the app shows a minimal start screen with
Open and recent files. The shell requires macOS 13.3 or later and uses the same
DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX editor components as the web apps.

The build requires Bun, wasm-pack 0.15.0, Binaryen, and the Rust
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. Swift builds the shell for both Mac architectures. It builds
editor assets automatically. To build assets once for all three bundles, run
`build-editor.sh` first, then set `BETTEROFFICE_DESKTOP_PREBUILT=1` when calling
`build-app.sh`. The Rust/Vello viewer remains available from `apps/native-viewer` through Cargo.
`package-dmg.sh DOCS_APP SHEETS_APP SLIDES_APP DMG` packages the suite with an
`/Applications` symlink.

The `macOS app` workflow runs for `@betteroffice/docx@<version>` tags, pull
requests and manual dispatches. Every run uploads an artifact suffixed
`-unsigned`. Non-PR runs can pass the `apple-signing` environment gate to also
sign, notarize, and staple all three apps and the disk image, then upload a
signed artifact. Tagged signed runs attach the disk image to that GitHub
release. A prerelease tag such as `@betteroffice/docx@0.2.0-rc.1` uses `0.2.0`
as the numeric macOS bundle version and keeps the full version in artifact
names.

## Secrets

Create an `apple-signing` environment with required reviewers, then create
these as environment secrets. All six are required for the signed path; if any
is missing the workflow retains only the unsigned artifact.

| Secret | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12` | Base64 of a Developer ID Application certificate exported as `.p12` |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | The password chosen during that export |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | The ten-character team id, shown in the Apple Developer account page |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` | Key id of an App Store Connect API key |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID` | Issuer id shown above the key list |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_P8` | Base64 of the `.p8` file, which downloads exactly once |

To export the certificate: request a Developer ID Application certificate in
Keychain Access, install it, then right-click it under My Certificates and
export as `.p12`. Encode both it and the `.p8` with `base64 -i FILE | pbcopy`.

An App Store Connect API key is used instead of an app-specific password so no
individual's Apple ID is embedded in CI. Create one under Users and Access >
Integrations with the Developer role.
