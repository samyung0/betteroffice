# BetterOffice redaction

Structure-preserving redaction for DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, VSDX, and VSTX packages. Text becomes
`x` runs (or independent random letters with `RedactionOptions {
random_characters: true }`), numbers become `8` runs, formulas become `0`,
dates become the epoch, booleans become `false`, and error values become
`#N/A`. Element counts, part names, and relationship targets are preserved.

## XLSX coverage

- Cells: shared strings, inline strings, string results, formulas, error
  values, numbers; sheet names; header/footer text.
- Comments: legacy authors and text; threaded-comment `text`, `dT`, and
  `xl/persons/person.xml` display names and user IDs. Person GUID links,
  `personId`, and `providerId` are kept so threads still resolve.
- Pivot caches: field names and captions, worksheet-source sheet names,
  shared-item and record string values; numbers, dates, booleans, and errors
  follow the placeholder policy above. Shared-item indexes are kept.
- Pivot tables and slicers: table, data-field, page-field, calculated-member,
  slicer, timeline, and cache names and captions; calculated-item formulas
  become `0`. Field and item indexes are kept.
- Connections: names, descriptions, connection strings, commands, parameter
  names, prompts, and values, text-import source files, web URLs and posts.
  Connection IDs are kept.
- External links: cached values, sheet names, defined names and `refersTo`,
  DDE service/topic/item names, OLE program IDs and item names.
- Tables and queries: table, column, query-table, and query-field names,
  table comments, totals-row labels, calculated-column formulas.
- Worksheets: hyperlinks, validation prompts, filter values, conditional-format
  match text, scenario names and comments, web-publish titles and destinations,
  OLE program IDs and links, control names.
- Rich data and metadata: rich-value strings and key names, metadata values.
- Document properties and custom properties; external-relationship targets
  become `https://example.com`.

## Visio coverage

VSDX drawings and VSTX templates use namespace-aware redaction regardless of
where their XML parts live. Shape text, names, properties, user data, comments,
external-data values, and other unrecognized attribute values are masked.
Images use the shared blank-media policy. Standard geometry rows, numeric
layout and formatting cells, and supported theme colors are preserved.

Relationship IDs are renamed together with their references. Named rows receive
unique anonymous names shared across the package so master inheritance still
matches. Unsafe formulas on geometry cells use their numeric cached value when
available; other unsafe formulas become `0`. Font names become Arial. These
changes can affect text layout and formula behavior, so inspect a redacted repro
before sharing it.

Inputs and outputs must pass the Visio parser. Missing relationship references,
ambiguous XML nesting, macro-enabled files, and stencils are refused. Part names,
namespace declarations, content types, relationship types, and internal targets
remain structural metadata and are preserved, as with the other formats.

The CLI supports both local output and `--share`; the upload worker validates
VSDX and VSTX separately using the OPC sanitizer.
