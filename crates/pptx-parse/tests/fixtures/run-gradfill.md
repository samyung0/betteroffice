`run-gradfill.pptx` is a generated regression deck licensed with this repository.
It provides a public reproduction for PR #299; the contributor's original corpus
is private and was not available for review.

The deck has two slides at 960 × 720 CSS pixels. Slide 1 contains these labels
on `#A81020` bands; slide 2 repeats only the three controls.

| Slide 1 shape ID | Label | Main color | Fixed color |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `slide:0:256:shape:0` | RGB gradient | `#505050` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `slide:0:256:shape:1` | Theme gradient (`lt1`) | `#505050` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `slide:0:256:shape:2` | Modified gradient (`204060`, 50% tint) | `#505050` | `#90A0B0` |
| `slide:0:256:shape:3` | Unsorted green/red ramp | `#505050` | `#00FF00` |
| `slide:0:256:shape:4` | Adjacent white/red and white/blue ramps | `#505050` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `slide:0:256:shape:5` | Solid control | `#FFFFFF` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `slide:0:256:shape:6` | Inherited control | `#505050` | `#505050` |
| `slide:0:256:shape:7` | Empty gradient | `#505050` | `#505050` |

The six authored gradient runs become five display-list text runs because the
adjacent runs have the same modeled style. Stops are deliberately stored in
reverse position order. The lowest valid stop is a fallback for multicolor
ramps; a single-color gradient renders exactly. The writer retains the authored
ramps when text or other formatting changes, including adjacent runs separated
by a soft line break, and replaces the fill when the resolved color changes.

Review: [PR #299](https://github.com/openooxml/betteroffice/pull/299).

The comparison in that PR uses `origin/main` at `1d0f41d9`. Both renders use the tracked
`LiberationSans-Regular.ttf`, registered as Arial. The font's SHA-256 is
`76d04c18ea243f426b7de1f3ad208e927008f961dc5945e5aad352d0dfde8ee8`.

Isolation against that main revision used the repository's locked dependency
versions and the same font registrations for all 16 PPTX fixtures, including both
demo copies and the new repro. Of 45 slides, 44 display lists are byte-identical.
The only differences are the five target run colors, each repeated in the
paragraph and positioned-line records: 10 JSON scalar changes. Every other
primitive, glyph position, and control is unchanged.

All 15 pre-existing package and snapshot JSON payloads are byte-identical.
Snapshots and collaboration updates for all 16 decks load in both revisions with
identical snapshot data. Fresh no-edit saves preserve all 273 OOXML ZIP part
payloads on each revision, checked independently with Python's `zipfile`.

Regression tests cover exact stop selection, invalid and empty stop lists, solid
fill priority, rendering, and saves after bold formatting, ASCII/Unicode text
insertion, and recoloring. Eight production mutations produce ten failing test
runs; restoring each change returns those tests to green, including the soft-line
break case. Multicolor ramps remain in the saved XML after non-color edits.
