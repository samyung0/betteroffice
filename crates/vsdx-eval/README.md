# betteroffice-vsdx-eval

Bounded ShapeSheet evaluator for the display baseline. It evaluates pure,
display-critical formulas with resolution-aware references, inheritance, package
themes and mutation policy checks. Unsupported formulas never fall back to cached
values.

## Supported formula profile

The evaluator supports bounded parsing and evaluation of numeric arithmetic,
comparisons, references, conditional and boolean expressions, common numeric and
trigonometric functions, units, `GUARD`, RGB colours and documented
colour transforms. It resolves shape, page, document and sheet references through
the VSDX resolver, and evaluates `THEMEVAL` when the required host context and
theme are present.

## Explicit non-goals

The following residual categories are intentionally outside this profile:

- Event cells (937): event and recalculation plumbing is not display evaluation.
- `Inh` has no concrete inherited value (825): catalog sheets have no inheritance
  graph, so resolving these values would manufacture results, and inheritance chains
  that exhaust before reaching a concrete value — including the `DocLangID` locale
  cells — have nothing to return.
- `THEMEVAL` without host context or a theme (2): theme values require both to be
  meaningful.
- `THEMEVAL` values outside the resolvable colour slots (238): non-colour theme
  data and variation-dependent colours stay unsupported rather than guessed.
- `SHADE` and `LUMDIFF`: their Visio semantics are undocumented, so they remain
  unsupported rather than guessed.

`SETATREF` is mutation policy, not formula evaluation: edits redirect only a
root-level, single local-cell target. Nested, multiple, missing, guarded, and
unsupported cross-sheet redirects are rejected.

The corpus harness compares evaluated formulas with Visio's cell `@V` cache,
interpreting `@V` using its `@U` display unit before comparison. Numeric agreement
requires both equal canonical magnitudes and equal dimensions. Those cache values
may be stale; the reported agreement rate is an imperfect compatibility signal,
not proof of exact Visio compatibility. Coverage and agreement must be measured
against the current engine revision and the exact corpus; no current percentages
are claimed here because the private corpus is not available in every checkout.

The oracle excludes only nine demonstrated stale cache encodings, pinned to their
corpus source parts and shapes: four `LineWeight` `F="Inh"` values from a prior
inheritance context, and five `LineWeight` `THEMEVAL("LineWeight",0.24PT)` values
whose raw `@V` was retained across a display-unit conversion. All other mismatches
remain disagreements.
