//! Word-specific measurement rules — the places where reproducing Word
//! demands something a generic text engine would not do.
//!
//! Each rule is a free function taking its inputs explicitly, including the
//! compat flags, so nothing here reads global state. ECMA-376 references are
//! to Part 1 (WordprocessingML); element semantics are summarized in
//! `reference/quick-ref/wordprocessingml.md` ("Spacing (w:spacing)" section
//! for line-rule value semantics and the twips/240ths unit table).
//!
//! # 1. Font-unit line height (single spacing) — [`single_line_box`]
//!
//! Word takes the default line height from the **`hhea`** family — the same
//! ascent, descent and leading CoreText reports — and ignores both the
//! `OS/2` usWin box and the sTypo family:
//!
//! ```text
//! pitch  = hhea.ascender − hhea.descender + hhea.lineGap
//! ascent = hhea.ascender + hhea.lineGap      (the whole gap sits above)
//! ```
//!
//! The `w:noLeading` compatibility flag (`w:compat`, ECMA-376 §17.15.3)
//! drops the lineGap, leaving the bare ascender-to-descender span.
//!
//! Measured on Word 16.113 and PowerPoint 16.113 (macOS); both applications
//! read the same family, so this rule is shared, not per-format. Verified on
//! Latin and script-neutral faces only. Arabic faces are **unverified** —
//! neither application could be made to lay out an Arabic-script face under
//! test here.
//!
//! The usWin family stays on [`crate::font_store::FontMetrics`] because the
//! opt-in experiments below still read it.
//!
//! ## 1a. East Asian faces — [`EAST_ASIAN_CODE_PAGES`]
//!
//! A face whose `OS/2` ulCodePageRange1 claims one of the four East Asian
//! code pages — 932 Shift-JIS (bit 17), 936 GB2312 (18), 949 Wansung (19),
//! 950 Big5 (20) — takes a different pitch entirely:
//!
//! ```text
//! pitch = 1.3 x (hhea.ascender - hhea.descender)
//! ```
//!
//! with the extra 0.3 split evenly above the ascender and below the
//! descender. `usWinAscent`/`usWinDescent`, `hhea.lineGap` and the sTypo
//! family are all ignored, including when `USE_TYPO_METRICS` is set.
//!
//! Measured against Word 16.113 on macOS across 65 installed faces and 30
//! synthesized ones. The gate is causal, not correlational: giving Arial a
//! single East Asian code page bit switches it to the East Asian pitch,
//! and clearing those bits on Arial Unicode MS switches it back, while
//! adding CJK cmap coverage, CJK `ulUnicodeRange` bits or a `vhea` table
//! changes nothing. Code page bit 21 (1361 Johab) does *not* gate.
//!
//! The 1.3 factor holds to 1e-4 on faces at 2048 units per em; faces at
//! 256 units per em measure 0.24% under it and faces at 1024 units per em
//! 0.08% over, a residual that no font-table field accounts for.
//!
//! # 2. Auto / exact / atLeast spacing — [`apply_spacing_rule`]
//!
//! `w:spacing w:lineRule` (§17.3.1.33):
//!
//! - `auto`: `w:line` is in 240ths of a line (240 = single, 276 = the 1.15
//!   default of recent Word styles, 480 = double). Word scales the *full*
//!   single-spacing pitch — including external leading — by `line/240`.
//!   Ascent and descent stay put; the delta lands in the leading below the
//!   descent, so cursor/selection rects hug the text at the top of the line
//!   box for spacing > single (observable Word behavior). Sub-single values
//!   that undercut ascent+descent shrink ascent/descent proportionally.
//! - `exact`: fixes the line box at the given height regardless of content —
//!   taller glyphs are *clipped* (at render time; measurement never grows
//!   the line). The baseline sits at [`EXACT_BASELINE_RATIO`] of the box, a
//!   constant depending on neither the font nor the size.
//! - `atLeast`: a floor — the measured content height wins when larger;
//!   when the floor wins the slack lands *above* the ascent, so the content
//!   descent is preserved from the bottom of the box.
//!
//! Both fixed rules are measured against Word 16.112. Word quantizes to a
//! 0.25pt device grid; this model is continuous, so an off-grid split differs
//! from Word's raster by up to an eighth of a point.
//!
//! Both fixed rules interact with inline objects (images taller than an
//! exact box also clip).
//!
//! # 3. Justification — [`line_is_justified`], [`stretch_spaces`]
//!
//! `w:jc w:val="both"` (§17.3.1.13) stretches **space clusters only** —
//! never inter-letter gaps — distributing the line's slack in equal shares
//! per expandable space cluster (`"distribute"` is the East Asian variant
//! that does stretch inter-character; not implemented here). The final line
//! of a paragraph is not justified, but a line ended by a soft return
//! (shift-enter, `w:br`) *is* — unless the `w:doNotExpandShiftReturn`
//! compat flag (§17.15.3) restores the non-stretching behavior. The
//! soft-return test takes precedence over the last-line flag. Space stretch
//! happens at line layout, after shaping: shaped cluster advances stay
//! fixed, only space-cluster advances grow.
//!
//! # 4. Snap-to-grid — [`snap_line_height`], [`snap_line_box`]
//!
//! Where a section defines a document grid (`w:docGrid`, §17.6.5) with an
//! activating type, Word fits each line's *content* box to the grid — the
//! single-spaced box, before rule 2's multiple — unless the paragraph or
//! run opts out (`w:snapToGrid` on pPr/rPr, §17.3.1/§17.3.2, defaulting to
//! on). The grid quantizes the line pitch; `auto` spacing then scales that
//! quantized pitch, so a 1.5-spaced line on a one-row grid is 1.5 grid rows
//! tall, not two. Callers thread the section's grid pitch and the
//! paragraph/run opt-outs in as inputs; this rule only rounds. It applies
//! after rule 1 and before rule 2, keeping ascent/descent put so the extra
//! lands below the descent, matching how rule 2 treats growth. Only
//! automatically-determined heights snap: pinned `exact` boxes are fixed
//! regardless of content and `atLeast` floors are author-set, so Word snaps
//! neither (measured against Word 16.112: an `atLeast`-ruled body under an
//! active grid keeps its natural pitch, not a grid multiple). Absolute
//! grid-phase alignment against the page origin is not modeled.
//!
//! The box rounds up to a *whole* number of rows. Measured off Word's own
//! exported references: on the `linesAndChars` grids of two Chinese theses
//! (326 and 312 twips) baseline gaps cluster at 1.00 and 1.50 rows for body
//! text and at exactly 2.00 for lines whose content outgrows a row, and a
//! Japanese `lines` grid at 360 twips puts its tallest lines at 3.00.
//!
//! This rounded up to one row only until the substituted faces carried the
//! requested face's metrics ([`crate::word_fonts`]). `linePitch` is authored
//! against the real East Asian face, so a substitute measuring a few percent
//! tall straddled the row boundary and a `ceil` turned that metric error into
//! a doubled line; capping at one row bought the fill the grid is for without
//! betting page counts on a metric the engine did not have. It has it now.
//!
//! Activation is narrow: only grid types `lines`, `linesAndChars` and
//! `snapToChars` snap. `default` (or a bare `linePitch` with no type) never
//! does. Callers enforce that; [`snap_line_height`] trusts a `Some` pitch.
//!
//! # 5. Kerning threshold — [`kern_enabled`], [`kern_features`]
//!
//! Word applies pair kerning only when the run's `w:kern` half-point
//! threshold (rPr, §17.3.2) is nonzero and the font size is at or above it.
//! An absent `w:kern` reads as zero — kerning off, not "unspecified, shape
//! however the font prefers".
//! [`mod@crate::shape`] applies default OpenType features (which include GPOS
//! pair kerning via the `kern` feature) unconditionally; callers gate it
//! per run by passing [`kern_features`]`(kern_enabled(..))` as the feature
//! list. rustybuzz honors `kern=0` for GPOS-carried kerning (proven against
//! the Liberation Sans fixture in `tests/ooxml_text.rs`), so no shaping-side
//! switch is needed.
//!
//! # 6. Compatibility flags from `settings.xml` — [`CompatFlags`]
//!
//! `w:compat` / `w:compatSetting` (§17.15.3) select metric eras. The two
//! flags rules 1 and 3 consume — `w:noLeading` and
//! `w:doNotExpandShiftReturn` — are carried by [`CompatFlags`], parsed from
//! `settings.xml` host-side and threaded in as inputs. No rule here reads
//! `compatibilityMode` (12/14/15), `w:useWord97LineBreakRules` or
//! `w:balanceSingleByteDoubleByteWidth`, so a document setting them measures
//! as though they were off.

//!
//! [`CompatFlags::gdi_line_metrics`] and [`CompatFlags::typo_line_spacing`]
//! are independent, opt-in experiments. GDI rounds ppem and components; typo
//! spacing selects version-4 `USE_TYPO_METRICS` with a signed gap. Both remain
//! unavailable to paragraph input because observed Word output did not quantize.
