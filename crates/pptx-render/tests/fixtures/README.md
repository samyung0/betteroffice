# Line ends

`line-ends.pptx` replaces slide 1 of the repository's demo deck with synthetic
line shapes. Slides 2 and 3 are unchanged. No external template is required.

The first five rows exercise `triangle`, `arrow`, `stealth`, `diamond`, and
`oval`. Each row uses width/length pairs `sm/lg`, `med/sm`, and `lg/med` at the
head, with the dimensions reversed at the tail. The remaining lines exercise
omitted and explicit `med` sizes, a 1 px stroke, rotation with horizontal flip,
absent ends, explicit `none`, and bent and curved preset geometry. The arrow row is dashed.

[ECMA-376 Part 1](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-376/),
sections 20.1.10.32–34, defines the three relative sizes and illustrates the five
marks. It depicts `arrow` as an open chevron and `stealth` as a notched arrow.
It does not prescribe numerical size multipliers.

The renderer uses 2, 3, and 5 times `max(stroke width, 0.7 mm)` for `sm`, `med`,
and `lg`; omitted dimensions use `med`. The filled-marker scale, minimum base,
and stealth notch at 60% of the length follow
[LibreOffice's DrawingML importer](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/master/oox/source/drawingml/lineproperties.cxx).
Open-chevron dimensions describe the stroke centerline, so its stroke extends
beyond those dimensions; LibreOffice instead builds an outlined polygon.
Diamond and oval marks are centered on their path endpoints.

For example, `triangle-lg-med` is a blue (`#315EFB`) 4 px line from `(880, 120)`
to `(1140, 120)`. Its head measures 20 × 12 px and its tail 12 × 20 px. On main,
its stroke JSON is `{"color":"#315EFB","width":4.0}`. With line ends enabled,
only `headEnd` and `tailEnd` are added. Both plain lines keep exactly that JSON.

# Picture crop and mask

`picture-crop-mask.pptx` derives from the tracked demo deck. Only slide 1's picture and its bitmap change; slides 2 and 3 remain controls.

The 1024×1024 bitmap has RGB `(floor(x / 4), floor(y / 4), 40)`. The picture uses `srcRect l="10000" t="20000" r="30000" b="10000"`, an ellipse, and a 2px `#FF00FF` outline in the frame `(100, 50, 200, 100)` CSS pixels.

The kept source rectangle is `(102.4, 204.8, 614.4, 716.8)` pixels. Rendering should crop that rectangle, clip it to the ellipse, and stroke the ellipse. [PR #288](https://github.com/openooxml/betteroffice/pull/288) shows the isolated picture on a 400×200 surface before and after the fix.

`outer-shadow.pptx` is hand-authored. Slide 1 places two 320x200 CSS-pixel round rectangles on a white ground, both carrying `outerShdw blurRad="76200" dist="38100" dir="2700000"` in 40% black: the left one is filled `#4472C4`, the right one has `a:noFill` and a red outline. The shadow resolves to 8px of blur 2.83px down and right, on both cards, using the painted fill and outline alpha. The hollow card stays white at its center. [PR #334](https://github.com/openooxml/betteroffice/pull/334) shows the complete 1280x720 surface before and after the fix.

`text-baseline-script.pptx` derives from the same deck. Only slide 1's subtitle changes: one paragraph whose `a:pPr/a:defRPr` carries `baseline="0"` and whose runs alternate between no shift, `baseline="30000"` and `baseline="-25000"` at `sz="1700"`. The zero must stay a no-op; the other two must shrink and shift their runs.

`outer-shadow-scale.pptx` derives from `outer-shadow.pptx`. The filled card uses
`sx="200000" sy="50000" algn="tr"`; the outlined card uses
`sx="-150000" sy="200000" algn="ctr"`. It covers unequal axes, a flipped shadow,
and source reattachment and edited-save round trips from schema 17 to 18.

`outer-shadow-picture.pptx` derives from `outer-shadow.pptx`. Slide 1 replaces the
two cards with two 240x240 CSS-pixel pictures of the same 64x64 bitmap, whose
middle 32x32 is opaque `#315EFB` and whose surrounding frame is fully
transparent. The left picture carries the same
`outerShdw blurRad="76200" dist="38100" dir="2700000"` in 40% black; the right
one carries no effect list. The left shadow must trace the opaque square, not
the 64x64 frame, so a frame-shaped shadow shows up as ink in the transparent
corners. A third shape below them fills the same bitmap through `a:blipFill`
under `ln/noFill` and the same effect list, covering the picture-filled shape
that layout rewrites into an image; a fourth, a `p:graphicFrame` whose OLE
fallback picture carries the same effect list, covers the graphic-frame path.
