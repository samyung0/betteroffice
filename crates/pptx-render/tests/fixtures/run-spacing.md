# Run character spacing

`run-spacing.pptx` reduces the XML from issue #324 to one slide, using the tracked demo deck as its package shell. It contains the `OUR GREEN INITIATIVES` title from the issue, mixed positive/zero/negative tracking, a tracked `spAutoFit` body, and a shape list-style default. The original `green-solutions` and `swot-analysis` decks are in [document 4.zip](https://github.com/Suparnapaul393/PowerPoint-Sample/blob/master/document%204.zip), linked from the contributor’s evidence README.

Compared with main `069e4d66` using the same Liberation Sans font files:

| Shape | Main | Fixed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Green title, `spc="600"`, 32 pt | 511.27078 px wide | 671.27075 px wide; 8 px gaps |
| Mixed tracking | One untracked run, 385.625 px | Three runs at 0, 8, and −1.33333 px; 410.9583 px |
| Shape autofit body | Shrunk to 21.33333 px | Keeps 42.66667 px and 4 px tracking |
| Inherited tracking | 461.47916 px | 529.4792 px with 4 px tracking |

The title stays centered at x=640 and retains `#008044`. The inherited text retains `#802020`, the mixed runs retain `#112233`, and the body retains `#224466`. Shape autofit no longer shrinks tracked text; growing its stored box remains a separate autofit feature.

Review: [PR #325](https://github.com/openooxml/betteroffice/pull/325).

Tests cover parsing, tracking, wrapping, hard breaks, ligatures, mixed runs, autofit, editing, and source recovery from the committed main v10 update.

The original green-solutions title (object 29) also grows from 511.27078 to 671.27075 px while retaining its x=640 center and white `#FFFFFF` paint. Only that text primitive changes.

On swot-analysis, only objects 42–49 change. STRENGTH grows from 132 to 160 px with 4 px gaps and retains `#0094C8`; the four body blocks keep their 16 px font and `#595959` colour while wrapping from five to seven lines. All other primitives are identical. These measurements verify tracking, not the remaining reference-renderer differences in shape autosizing or font metrics.
