# Bitmap colour effects

`blip-effects.pptx` is a synthetic, publishable reproduction of #311. Its only
bitmap has six swatches: opaque `03A7DF`, black, white and red, followed by white
at alpha 128 and 0. All slide, layout and master pictures share that bitmap.

The six rows at x=16 are: control, biLevel at 50%, duotone, colour change followed
by duotone, colour change with `useA="0"`, and grayscale. The pictures at x=336
exercise the layout and master paths. The background is `D0D0D0`.

Duotone uses `bg2` (white `lt2`) shaded to `737373`, then white. Colour change
maps white to transparent red. `useA="0"` instead changes RGB and preserves the
original alpha. The default matches both RGB and alpha, keeping translucent
white edges intact. See [MS-OI29500, §2.1.1287](https://officeprotocoldoc.z19.web.core.windows.net/files/MS-OI29500/%5BMS-OI29500%5D-170919.pdf), page 506.

Review: [PR #312](https://github.com/openooxml/betteroffice/pull/312).

The display-list comparison has eight images, seven with
effects added and one unchanged control. No other primitive fields change.
