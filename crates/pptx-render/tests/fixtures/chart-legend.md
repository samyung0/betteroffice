# Chart legends and titles

`chart-legend.pptx` derives from the tracked
`crates/pptx-parse/tests/fixtures/chart-deck.pptx`. It retains the first chart,
its two series, theme and axes, and removes the deliberately broken chart frame.
It contains no external presentation content.

The chart frame is `(96, 96, 576, 336)` CSS pixels. Narrow cases use width 200.
North has values `[12, 19, 7]` and colour `#6254E7`; South has values
`[8, 14, 21]` and colour `#1FA97A`. The title is `Revenue`.

| Slide | Case |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Bottom legend |
| 2 | Top legend |
| 3 | Right legend, title alignment control |
| 4 | Left legend, title alignment control |
| 5 | Bottom legend, narrow frame, long series names |
| 6 | Top legend with a 30pt legend font |
| 7 | Right legend with all chart and axis titles removed; unchanged control |
| 8 | Bottom legend on a horizontal bar chart |
| 9 | Bottom legend, narrow frame, ten `W` and ten `M` characters |
| 10 | Bottom legend, narrow frame, multi-line series names |

`chart_legend.rs` checks placement, separation, complete wrapped text, shaped
widths and title alignment. The shared geometry tests additionally check pie
and radar regions, column legends and returned plot width.

[PR #316](https://github.com/openooxml/betteroffice/pull/316) compares main at
`069e4d66` with the fix. Both render slide 1 with the same Liberation Sans regular and bold fonts under
the deck's Calibri family, at 96 dpi. The title's shaped centre moves from
`131.095` to the frame centre, `384`. The legend swatches move from the right
column at `(574, 132)` and `(574, 147)` to the bottom band at `y=417`.
The plot grows from 420 to 516 pixels wide and shrinks from 274 to 252 pixels
high. The retained 8px outer margin accounts for the 96px width increase.

The long-label comparison in that PR shows slide 5 before and after the review corrections.
The contributor's single row overlaps the two labels and clips the second at
the chart edge; the corrected layout gives each entry a complete row.
