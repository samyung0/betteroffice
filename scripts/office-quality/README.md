# Office visual quality harness

Compare DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX renders against Microsoft Office. Inputs and generated files stay in ignored `.source/office-quality/`; references come from the public corpus.

## Scoring

SSIM is the mean page-penalized grayscale score at 150 DPI, without resampling or alignment correction. DOCX uses recorded page bounds with at most a one-pixel edge adjustment. Missing or extra pages are penalized. Exact page counts are the documents whose rendered page count equals the reference; absolute page error sums the per-document difference. BetterOffice browser renders use pinned CDN fonts; native DOCX and LibreOffice share bundled fonts in CI. XLSX uses recorded print ranges and scale; its score measures range rendering, not automatic print pagination. Means cover successful comparisons only; failed or missing comparisons have no score. Compare coverage alongside SSIM because the channels may score different subsets.

## Local benchmark

Run from the repository root with Bun, Node.js, Python 3.13, and the project's Rust/Wasm toolchain installed:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build:packages
bunx playwright install chromium
python3 -m venv .source/office-quality/venv
.source/office-quality/venv/bin/pip install -r scripts/office-quality/requirements.txt

QUALITY_PYTHON=.source/office-quality/venv/bin/python \
QUALITY_OUTPUT=.source/office-quality/run \
  node scripts/office-quality/run.mjs
node scripts/office-quality/readme.mjs .source/office-quality/run/report.json
```

The runner compares the latest npm releases with the checked-out source using pinned CDN fonts. Commit source changes first and choose an empty output directory. The single [`office-quality` collection](https://corpus.betteroffice.dev/collections/office-quality.json) contains all three formats, including PPTArena. Set `QUALITY_FORMAT=docx`, `pptx`, or `xlsx` to measure one format, or `QUALITY_SAMPLES='["betteroffice-demo"]'` for explicit samples. Runs support up to 1,000 samples.

DOCX references and page-bounds profiles support 1–250 pages. PPTX, XLSX, and VSDX references remain limited to 100 pages, matching their capture harness. Extra rendered DOCX pages retain their native dimensions and contribute to the page-count penalty. Source documents may be up to 128 MiB; individual reference images remain limited to 32 MiB. Assets are verified against their recorded sizes and SHA-256 hashes before capture.

Corpus downloads retry transient failures (HTTP 408/429/5xx plus connection and body interruptions) with bounded attempts, exponential backoff with jitter, and capped `Retry-After` waits. Set `QUALITY_ASSET_CACHE` to a directory outside `QUALITY_OUTPUT` to reuse verified source and reference assets across runs; collection, metadata, and npm registry responses are always fetched fresh, and each cached blob is re-verified by exact size and SHA-256 on every hit. CI restores and saves this cache under runner temp storage. A persistent repair marker changes the archive key when corrupt blobs are replaced; unchanged warm caches retain their key.

Capture and comparison failures are recorded per sample and channel without stopping the remaining samples. The report includes scored/total coverage and concise failure reasons; the generated README shows scores and coverage. Failed comparisons have no SSIM and are excluded from the means; differing coverage can make channel means incomparable. Source/reference metadata, downloads, and hash validation still fail the run before capture. Invalid successful comparison records cannot be published.

XLSX capture uses `printDisplayList` when available, with font metrics measured
at 72 layout DPI for the frozen Mac Office capture and the worksheet's explicit defaults.
The Normal style resolves through its built-in ID and `xfId`; missing declarations fall back to style XF zero, then font zero.
Older packages use the screen-range capture. Both keep the recorded ranges,
150-DPI output, page margins, and SSIM scoring. Per-capture metadata identifies
the mode and metrics. Unspecified column defaults, locale-specific dates, and
chart typography can still differ from Excel.

## Manual CI and generated README

After the [workflow](../../.github/workflows/visual-fidelity.yml) lands on `main`, use **Actions → Benchmarks → Run workflow**, or:

```sh
gh workflow run visual-fidelity.yml --ref main -f branch=main
```

Keep `--ref main`; set `branch` to the repository branch to measure. The optional `samples` input selects explicit samples. A preparation job freezes the source revision, package versions, each published package's npm `gitHead`, and corpus metadata. DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX then evaluate in parallel, each with its own asset cache and 90-minute budget. Each browser capture retains its 600-second deadline. Two independent native build jobs feed up to four DOCX benchmark jobs, with whole documents distributed by reference page count. Every timed competitor for a document runs sequentially on the same worker; browser capture and compilation run on other workers.

The final job requires every selected format and sample, combines the original comparisons, and updates the [README scores](../../README.md#benchmarks) as `openooxml-bot[bot]`. Unchanged results create no commit; a changed branch head requires a rerun. Runs are manual only. Score JSON and generated Markdown are retained for 30 days; per-format reports and optional commit PNGs are transferred as seven-day artifacts.

## Native DOCX and LibreOffice

The DOCX table adds LibreOffice fidelity and a native CLI render-time row. BetterOffice fidelity still measures the browser renderer at 150 DPI. Native timings exercise the Rust rasterizer at 96 DPI; they do not claim that it has the browser renderer's fidelity or feature coverage. PPTX adds the same render-time comparison; XLSX adds LibreOffice SSIM, recalculation accuracy and recalculation time.

Both BetterOffice executables use the same [`native/main.rs`](native/main.rs) host, compiled in release mode (`opt-level=3`, thin LTO), against the frozen current source and the exact source of the published npm version. The host reads the original DOCX, imports it into the engine, loads fonts, lays out the document, constructs the display list, rasterizes page one, PNG-encodes it, and writes the file. All of that work and process startup are timed. No prepared layout, display list, resident engine, Wasm, or browser is supplied to the executable. Unsupported raster operations, skipped images, blank output for a nonblank reference, and invalid output dimensions count as failures.

LibreOffice uses the official prebuilt Linux 26.2.3.2 release, verified against its pinned SHA-256, on Ubuntu 24.04. Its native CLI imports the same DOCX and exports page one directly through [`writer_png_Export`](https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/shared/guide/graphic_export_params.html). Each document has an isolated LibreOffice profile, initialized during the discarded warmup. No resident office server is used. PNG export requests the reference page's physical size at 96 DPI; validation permits the native exporters' one-pixel rounding difference without resampling.

The driver discards one warmup per engine/document, then starts five fresh processes per engine, rotating execution order. Timings include process startup and file I/O; validation, scoring, installation, and builds are outside the timer. OS file caches remain warm. The row is an arithmetic mean of per-document means, using only documents that complete every trial in all three engines. Per-engine timing coverage and the common subset are recorded in the report artifacts. A failed trial removes that document from all three aggregate means; it never becomes a zero or a partial average. There are no speedup thresholds or cached timing results. Hosted-runner timing varies, so compare columns within the same run rather than treating small changes between runs as regressions.

The current source's bundled fonts are frozen once and shared by both native builds and LibreOffice. Linux workers use a Fontconfig configuration restricted to that bundle, including its Word-family aliases. Build metadata records source/binary/host hashes, Rust version and optimization settings; reports record fonts, LibreOffice build, runner image, architecture, and comparison-library versions. Local macOS LibreOffice uses system font discovery and reports that distinction.

LibreOffice fidelity separately exports the entire document to PDF, rasterizes every page through the pinned PyMuPDF version at 150 DPI, and uses the same Word references, grayscale SSIM, page penalties, and at-most-one-pixel edge adjustment as the existing DOCX comparison. It does not replace the Office references. Sources and references are hash-verified. Scoring omits redundant HTML-gallery PNGs and logs page progress; individual LibreOffice renders remain in artifacts. All selected documents are attempted on every run. Failures stay visible in coverage and diagnostics.

The reconciler requires every planned shard and document, matching plan hashes, builds, font bundles, versions, and measurement settings before updating the README or R2. Download `docx-benchmark-diagnostics-*` for per-trial durations, commands, logs, first-page native PNGs, and full LibreOffice renders. These artifacts expire after seven days. `docx-native-*` contains the executable builds and font bundle. Artifacts are never committed.

To run a local shard after preparing `plan.json` and checking out its published `gitHead`:

```sh
bun scripts/office-quality/native-fonts.ts .source/native-fonts
node scripts/office-quality/build-native.mjs . .source/native/commit
node scripts/office-quality/build-native.mjs /path/to/published-checkout .source/native/published
QUALITY_PLAN=.source/office-quality/plan/plan.json QUALITY_SHARD=0 \
  QUALITY_OUTPUT=.source/docx-benchmark node scripts/office-quality/docx-benchmark.mjs
QUALITY_OUTPUT=.source/docx-benchmark QUALITY_NATIVE=.source/native \
  QUALITY_FONTS=.source/native-fonts/manifest.json \
  python3 scripts/office-quality/docx_benchmark.py
```

Set `SOFFICE` to the native LibreOffice executable when it is not available as `libreoffice`. Use a fresh output directory for each run. `docxShards(plan)` in `docx-benchmark.mjs` lists the complete shard assignment; small explicit selections create fewer workers automatically.

## Published renders and the viewer

With `publish_renders` left on, the final job uploads the reconciled `commit` channel to the
`betteroffice-fidelity` R2 bucket, keyed by the measured commit:

```text
renders/<sha>/<sample>/page_0001.png
renders/<sha>/report.json
renders/latest.json
```

Uploads use Bun’s S3 client with the existing `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secrets. The publisher verifies the account or user token,
then derives its S3 credentials as [documented by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/tokens/#get-s3-api-credentials-from-an-api-token).
Bucket-scoped Object Read & Write access to `betteroffice-fidelity` is sufficient.

`latest.json` names the current SHA, its report key, and the published page count per sample. It is
written last, so it never points at an incomplete upload. Every published SHA is kept.

Missing format reports or incomplete render artifacts prevent publication. An R2 upload failure
also stops the final job before the README update. [`apps/fidelity`](../../apps/fidelity)
serves those renders next to the public Office references, so a page can be compared by swiping or
by a difference blend. It reads scores only from `report.json` and never derives its own.

## Office references

Requires macOS and desktop Word, PowerPoint, or Excel. Run exports serially into fresh directories:

```sh
.source/office-quality/venv/bin/python scripts/office-quality/reference.py \
  /path/to/example.docx --out .source/office-quality/example/office
```

The extension selects the app. Output includes `reference.pdf`, numbered PNGs at 150 DPI, and `result.json` with source hashes, Office/macOS versions, font names, UTC timestamps, and export status. The timeout defaults to 120 seconds; override it with `--timeout`.

For XLSX comparisons, add `--xlsx-profile /path/to/profile.json`. The profile specifies `scale_percent`, `margin_pt`, and `pages` with zero-based `sheet` indices and A1 `range` values. Each range must fit one page. The demo's nine-page profile is stored in its metadata under `reference.capture_profile`. This measures worksheet range rendering, not automatic print pagination. The print API ignores frozen panes; the screen-range fallback rejects them. Print settings apply only to the temporary workbook, leaving source bytes unchanged.

## macOS permissions

Verified with Office 16.112.3 on macOS 26.2.

- In **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation**, allow the app running the command to control Word, PowerPoint, or Excel.
- Allow Office-container access if prompted. The exporter stages both input and PDF inside `~/Library/Containers/<Office bundle>/Data/Documents/BetterOfficeBenchmark/`. This avoided Word's repeated per-file grants without changing Full Disk Access. Successful staging directories are removed; failed exports retain them for inspection.
- Complete Office's first-run screens before exporting. PowerPoint's welcome screen can cause errors `-9074` or `-2710`. Check for open dialogs after a timeout.

The scripts use local PDF export. For manual Word exports, choose **Best for printing** or **Print → Save as PDF** to keep processing local.

## Compare local captures

Capture BetterOffice using the [DOCX instructions](../docx-quality/README.md). For PPTX/XLSX/VSDX, set `QUALITY_FORMAT=pptx`, `xlsx`, or `vsdx` on the shared server and use the matching `?format=` in the capture URL. Document bytes stay local; external browser requests are limited to pinned font files.

`reference.py` exports no Visio references and the benchmark run covers DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX only, so captured VSDX pages have no baseline to score against. `apps/demo/public/betteroffice-demo.vsdx` is a committed diagram to capture. Pages composite onto white because Visio pages carry no painted background.

DOCX references record each PDF page's physical and raster bounds. The capture profile permits a one-pixel canvas extent difference on each axis, adding white space or clipping at the right/bottom edge without moving or resampling rendered content. Larger differences fail; extra renderer pages retain their native bounds. Captures record the original and output dimensions for each page.

For DOCX and XLSX, load the reference profile before running the capture command. Collection runs do this automatically:

```sh
export QUALITY_CAPTURE_CONFIG="$(jq -c '.capture_profile // null' .source/office-quality/example/office/result.json)"
```

```sh
.source/office-quality/venv/bin/python scripts/office-quality/compare.py \
  .source/office-quality/example/office .source/office-quality/example/betteroffice \
  --out .source/office-quality/example/diff
open .source/office-quality/example/diff/index.html
```

Inputs may be PDFs or directories of `page_0001.png`, etc. The comparator checks available source hashes, render status, page counts, and DPI, then writes `score.json` and an HTML image diff. SSIM uses grayscale pixels at 150 DPI; missing or extra pages reduce the score. Dimensions must match unless `--resize` is explicitly requested. The benchmark does not resize or align captures.

## Public corpus

The `betteroffice-corpus` R2 bucket is served at **https://corpus.betteroffice.dev**. Each sample has its own folder:

```text
<sample>/
  source.<format>
  metadata.json
  reference/page_0001.png
  reference/page_0002.png
  ...
```

Browse the [corpus index](https://corpus.betteroffice.dev/) for current samples, source downloads, Office references, provenance, and third-party notices. Collection manifests record the exact sample IDs selected for each benchmark.

`bo-corpus-2` uses Arial throughout, resolved by the renderer to the registry's metric-compatible Liberation Sans. Its Word reference was regenerated from that converted source; the pair uses different font files, and the metadata records the font normalization and previous reference.

Collection manifests live at `collections/<id>.json` with `schema_version: 1`, the collection `id`, and a `samples` array of folder names. Sample metadata links the source and PNGs and records capture provenance, hashes, comparisons, and licensing. Public sample files, references, and license notices live in the bucket; original private inputs stay local. Publishing additional authorized samples requires authenticated Wrangler:

```sh
bunx wrangler r2 object put betteroffice-corpus/<key> --file <local-file> --remote
```

## Spreadsheet calculations

XLSX calculation accuracy compares independently recomputed formula results against Microsoft Excel references. The corpus references are captured on macOS with `xlsx_calc_reference.py`: formula caches and declared array-result caches are cleared, automatic calculation is enabled, and two full dependency rebuilds must produce identical values. Volatile, external-data, and macro-bearing inputs require a separate controlled oracle and are rejected by this capture tool. Original corpus workbooks remain unchanged. References record the source and prepared-input hashes, Excel version, worksheet identities, and result cells; empty reference outputs are recorded but excluded from scoring.

The [Sheetpedia calculation manifest](https://corpus.betteroffice.dev/datasets/sheetpedia/calculation.json) records the published Excel reference coverage.

The corpus stores the exact cache-cleared XLSX that Excel evaluated, with its hash in the reference record. CI verifies its package contents against the original workbook with formula caches cleared, so ZIP compression differences between platforms cannot change the input identity.

The benchmark gives the same prepared XLSX to the compiled BetterOffice published and commit versions and LibreOffice Calc. The numeric comparison accepts an absolute difference of at most the larger of `1e-9` and `1e-12 × max(|expected|, |actual|)`. Text, booleans, and Excel error codes must match exactly by type and value. Accuracy is the fraction of reference result cells that match, including declared array outputs. Missing results and failed workbook calculations count as incorrect; unsupported formulas cannot earn credit from imported caches. Per-workbook results and up to 100 mismatches per channel are retained in the artifacts. Reference coverage, workbooks without formulas, and workbooks without calculation references are reported separately in `xlsx_benchmark.reference_coverage`.

Recalculation timing measures the complete native CLI operation: process startup, XLSX import, recalculation, and XLSX export. Both BetterOffice builds use the same harness, compiler, and release profile. Each workbook runs once for warmup and five times for measurement, rotating engine order. The displayed arithmetic means cover the same workbooks for which every engine matches every reference result on every trial. Raw timings and accuracy remain available for other workbooks; they do not contribute to that speed comparison. Four shards balance the workload by reference result count and run alongside rendering.

## LibreOffice presentations

PPTX has an independent benchmark worker and two native build jobs. It renders the same frozen corpus files to PDF using `impress_pdf_Export`, rasterizes at 150 DPI, and uses the existing PowerPoint references, SSIM calculation, and slide-count penalties. It shares DOCX’s pinned LibreOffice release and font bundle. The existing one-pixel edge correction handles PDF raster rounding without resampling or image alignment. Failures and scored coverage are retained. Native render timing compares the published and current Rust crates against the prebuilt LibreOffice CLI, using the same warmup, five fresh processes, rotation, 96-DPI PNG validation, and common successful subset as DOCX. The BetterOffice host imports the original presentation, registers the frozen font bundle and aliases, renders slide one, and writes its PNG; LibreOffice uses [`impress_png_Export`](https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/shared/guide/graphic_export_params.html). The table shows SSIM, scored coverage, and render time, with pagination metrics reserved for DOCX. The reconciler requires this worker’s report before publishing the combined tables.


## LibreOffice spreadsheet fidelity

Up to four independent workers render every selected XLSX, including workbooks without formula references. They use the same frozen source, Excel PNG references, bundled fonts, pinned LibreOffice build, and 150-DPI grayscale SSIM as the other format comparisons. The XLSX table shows LibreOffice SSIM and scored/total alongside recalculation accuracy and time. Per-cell mismatches and reference coverage remain in the JSON artifacts.

Each recorded range is exported separately through `calc_pdf_Export`. A temporary copy selects its worksheet, hides the others, and applies the reference's print area, fixed scale, landscape paper size, margins, gridlines, and empty headers/footers and print titles. Source cells, formulas, and cached values are retained. LibreOffice may recalculate on import. [Print ranges](https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-GB/text/scalc/guide/printranges.html) constrain the export; whole-sheet export and fit-to-page scaling are disabled. Recorded Letter, Legal, A3 and A4 paper dimensions are supported; an unknown size fails explicitly.

Each range must produce exactly one PDF page at the recorded physical dimensions. Overflow, a missing range, or a larger raster-size mismatch fails the workbook comparison and reduces scored/total. Raster rounding permits at most one pixel of right/bottom edge adjustment; no resizing or alignment correction is applied. SSIM averages successful workbook comparisons only, so compare coverage too.

The final reconciler requires every XLSX render shard, including explicit failures, and matching plan, source, font and LibreOffice identities. It rejects a different LibreOffice build between fidelity and recalculation. `xlsx-fidelity-diagnostics-*` retains the prepared range workbooks, PDF exports, PNGs, logs and source/prepared hashes for seven days. No generated assets are committed.

## Parse success and edit/save preservation

The benchmark compares the published and current Rust facades with the pinned LibreOffice release for DOCX, PPTX and XLSX. Every selected corpus original is attempted, independently of its render or calculation result. Parse success is the percentage for which the normal native `open` API succeeds or LibreOffice loads the file as the correct document type. It does not establish complete feature support or rendering fidelity. A later edit, save, reopen or preservation failure cannot erase that parse success.

Preservation diagnostics remain experimental and are not displayed as a `Lossless roundtrip` percentage in the README. One deterministic probe is chosen from the original package and given unchanged to all three engines: append a marker to an unambiguous single-run paragraph/text box for DOCX/PPTX, or change the first finite numeric literal to zero (one if already zero) for XLSX. The original stays unchanged. Each engine must perform the edit, save, reopen its output and verify the new value. Files without an eligible probe, errors and timeouts remain non-passes in the raw full-corpus totals, with their reasons recorded. A no-op save cannot pass.

An independent ZIP/XML checker then compares the original with the saved package. Part names must match exactly; every part outside the edited XML part must retain identical uncompressed bytes, including unknown XML, relationships, custom parts and embedded files. The edited part must match the original XML tree with only the selected text/value replaced. Its other elements, attributes, namespace bindings, comments and text remain significant. Attribute ordering, XML declaration spelling, escaping and empty-element spelling in that one part do not affect the result. ZIP entry order, compression and timestamps are excluded.

This is a strict preservation probe, not a verdict that every non-pass lost user content: even benign serialization changes outside the edit, updated metadata, or dependent formula-cache recalculation fail it. No part, formula cache, extension or subtree is broadly exempted. One passing edit also does not prove all edits are lossless. The per-file artifacts distinguish parse/edit/save/reopen failures from added, removed or changed parts and an edited-part mismatch.

LibreOffice uses the bundled Python/UNO runtime from the same pinned Linux installation as the other comparisons. Each file gets its own headless process, profile and private UNO pipe. It loads the original with macros and external updates disabled, performs the same edit through Writer/Impress/Calc APIs, and saves with the [OOXML export filter](https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/shared/guide/convertfilters.html) before reopening. Runtime setup is checked before measuring any files. The original is never pre-edited on LibreOffice’s behalf.

The README shows only parse success from these probes. Preservation counts, exact edit footprints, source/output hashes and diagnostics stay in `roundtrip_benchmark` and per-sample `roundtrip`/`roundtrip_probe` report fields. SSIM, recalculation accuracy and timing comparisons continue separately.

Two native builds per selected format feed batches of at most 16 files, with four files processed concurrently per worker. Each file runs all three channels sequentially in fresh processes with independent 180-second limits. Probe selection and each preservation check run in separate processes with 30-second limits. Even if every engine and helper reaches its limit, one batch spends at most 44 minutes on those subprocesses, leaving room for installation, downloads and artifacts within the 90-minute job. Timeout cleanup kills the process group, including LibreOffice children; already recorded parse successes survive a later timeout. These probes do not contribute to timing metrics. The reconciler requires every planned shard and file, all three channels, matching source/build/checker/LibreOffice identities and explicit preservation evidence before publication. `roundtrip-diagnostics-*` retains saved documents, probe definitions and process logs for seven days. Runs remain manual; adding this harness does not refresh the current README numbers.

Compile-check a host without executing measurements:

```sh
node scripts/office-quality/build-roundtrip.mjs docx /path/to/source .source/roundtrip-check --check
```
