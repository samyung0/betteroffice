# @betteroffice/fonts

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1d830df: Add a CDN-only font provider, settle Japanese font preflight without retry loops, and preserve floating header shapes without inflating body margins. Load and save alternate main-document filenames through their package relationships, and forward layout failures through the editor error callback.

### Patch Changes

- 2c658b6: Improve DOCX pagination, list formatting, justified text, header and footer spacing, anchored shapes, content-control text, and table geometry to better match Word. Use Carlito as the related fallback for Calibri Light.
- 1f5892e: Pin the CDN entry's jsDelivr URLs to the installed package versions instead of a hardcoded release.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6be0c18: Bundled metric-compatible fonts ship as `@betteroffice/fonts`, plus `@betteroffice/fonts-cjk` for Chinese, Japanese or Korean, and DOCX uses them only when you hand the module over: `configureDefaultFonts({ fonts })`, or `configureDefaultFonts({ load: () => import('@betteroffice/fonts') })` to keep it in its own chunk. Installing the packages alone does nothing — without that call the engine reaches for no font package, measurement falls back to the browser, and pagination will not match Word. Because `@betteroffice/docx` no longer names `@betteroffice/fonts` anywhere in its published bundle, an esbuild consumer without the optional peer builds again.
