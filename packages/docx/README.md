# @betteroffice/docx

Framework-free core for the BetterOffice DOCX editor — the Rust engine (OOXML
parse/serialize, CRDT editing core, text shaping, pagination) compiled to
WebAssembly, plus the display-list, canvas-render, geometry, and accessibility
helpers the adapters build on. Layout never touches the DOM: the engine
measures every line and pages are replayed onto canvas.

```bash
bun add @betteroffice/docx
```

Most apps want the turnkey React component in
[`@betteroffice/docx-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@betteroffice/docx-react).
Reach for this package directly for headless parsing/serialization or when
building a custom adapter.

## Parse and save

A full round trip: open a `.docx`, inspect the typed model, write bytes back.

```ts
import { readFile, writeFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import { parseDocx, repackDocx } from "@betteroffice/docx/docx";

const document = await parseDocx(await readFile("contract.docx"));
// document.package: body, styles, numbering, theme, media, headers/footers

const bytes = await repackDocx(document);
await writeFile("contract-out.docx", Buffer.from(bytes));
```

`repackDocx` round-trips against the original buffer so untouched parts are
preserved; use `createDocx` for documents built from scratch.

The engine ships separate viewer and editor wasm assets alongside its container,
parser, and layout cores. `@betteroffice/docx/viewer` opens a read-only document
and retains only its immutable display list; editing and save methods are not
exported. Browsers fetch assets lazily behind the async entry points; Node and
Bun read them from disk synchronously on first use. No manual init call is
required.

## Collaboration

Connect the editor's Yrs replica to any reliable binary transport:

```ts
import { CollaborationProvider } from "@betteroffice/docx/collaboration";

const provider = new CollaborationProvider(replica, createTransport(), {
  user: { name: "Ada" }, // identity for this peer's remote caret
});
provider.connect();
```

`replica` can be a direct `YrsSession`, the worker-aware adapter returned by
`createWorkerCollaborationReplica`, or the value published by the React
editor's `collaboration.onReplica` callback. The provider speaks Yjs sync-v1;
room routing, authentication, awareness, and reconnection policy remain
transport concerns. Pass a persisted Yrs update as `collaboration.initialUpdate`
when a React editor joins an existing room so it hydrates the shared history
instead of independently importing the same DOCX.

## Development

The generated `.wasm` binaries are intentionally not committed. From the
repository root, install `wasm-pack` 0.15.0 and `binaryen`, then run
`bun run build:docx-wasm`.
Package builds, demo startup, and CI run this step automatically.

### Undo capture modes and boundaries

`session.setUndoCaptureMode(mode)` selects how tracked local transactions are
combined into undo steps. `session.undoCaptureMode()` returns the current mode.

| Mode | Grouping |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` (default) | Edits within 500 ms coalesce; switching stories closes the group. |
| `manual` | Edits coalesce across pauses and stories until an explicit boundary. |

`session.addUndoBoundary()` closes the current group in any mode. Changing modes
also closes the group; setting the same mode again does not. Both operations
preserve undo/redo history and are safe before capture starts. Repeated boundaries
create no empty undo steps. Remote transactions remain outside local undo history.

```ts
session.setUndoCaptureMode('manual');
session.insertText(firstLocation, 'Prefixo ');
session.insertText(secondLocation, 'Suffix');
session.addUndoBoundary();
session.deleteRange(markerRange);
session.addUndoBoundary();
session.setUndoCaptureMode('auto');
```

The two insertions undo together; marker deletion is a separate step. Boundaries
are also available in automatic mode when a host action needs to be isolated from
surrounding typing. Undo/redo close capture as usual. Manual mode controls history
grouping; it does not defer updates, flush pending input, or provide atomic execution.
The host must close manual groups so later unrelated edits do not join them.
