### Patch Changes

- 34541ae: PPTX decks now save with edits included, across every surface. The engine diffs the live CRDT state against a freshly seeded copy of the source package and writes back only what changed: untouched slides keep their exact source part bytes, edited slides are patched at the XML level so unmodeled markup — transitions, timing, unknown attributes — survives, and inserted or deleted slides rewrite `presentation.xml`, its relationships, and `[Content_Types].xml`. `Presentation::save()` in `betteroffice-pptx` no longer discards edits, `PresentationHandle.save()` returns the bytes on the npm core, `PptxEditor` gains a save toolbar button, Ctrl/Cmd+S, `onSave` and `fileName` props, and `save` on its `onReady` api, and the Python binding's `save`/`save_path` serialize edited decks instead of raising — `UnsupportedWriteError` is gone.

  Inside an edited paragraph, untouched runs keep their exact source markup; an edit contained in a single source run is rebuilt onto that run's properties, so hyperlinks, strikethrough, and spacing survive it. An edit spanning several source runs rewrites the span from the modeled styling — hyperlink and field bindings inside that span do not survive, which is the known write-back limitation.

### Patch Changes

- 5212690: Google Slides-style editor toolbar for the PPTX editor: new-slide split button
  with layout picker, undo/redo, zoom, select and text-box tools, and contextual
  text formatting that also applies to whole shapes on selection. Text formatting
  now spans paragraph boundaries as a single undoable operation, double/triple
  click select word/paragraph, and roundRect corners render circular per the
  OOXML adj value instead of stretching with the shape.
- b87185f: Shape insertion and styling: a Slides-style shape picker inserts preset
  geometries (rectangles, ellipse, polygons, stars, arrows, chevron) by click
  or drag, and selected shapes get contextual fill, border color, border width,
  and corner-radius controls backed by new undoable, collaboration-native
  addShape/setShapeFill/setShapeStroke/setShapeAdjust engine operations.
