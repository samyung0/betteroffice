### Patch Changes

- b962e66: Every OOXML chart family now draws with its own renderer instead of falling through to bars: area, scatter, bubble, radar, stock and surface join bar, line and pie. Stacked and percent-stacked grouping, gap width and overlap, marker symbols, data labels composed from `c:dLbls`, chart text from `c:txPr`, log scales, reversed axes, tick marks, gridlines and secondary value axes are all honoured, and `lumMod`, `lumOff` and `satMod` colour modifiers resolve so themed charts no longer draw oversaturated. Fixes horizontal bar charts, which ignored the zero baseline and drew negative values as nothing.
- 1b6a249: Charts in a presentation render for real instead of drawing a grey placeholder. Chart parts are loaded through the slide, layout and master relationship cascade, their colours resolve against the deck theme, and the plot streams into slide primitives with an accessible label. Data labels, axis titles and per-point colours draw, and an `ofPie` group now plots as a pie rather than as columns.
- 34541ae: PPTX decks now save with edits included, across every surface. The engine diffs the live CRDT state against a freshly seeded copy of the source package and writes back only what changed: untouched slides keep their exact source part bytes, edited slides are patched at the XML level so unmodeled markup — transitions, timing, unknown attributes — survives, and inserted or deleted slides rewrite `presentation.xml`, its relationships, and `[Content_Types].xml`. `Presentation::save()` in `betteroffice-pptx` no longer discards edits, `PresentationHandle.save()` returns the bytes on the npm core, `PptxEditor` gains a save toolbar button, Ctrl/Cmd+S, `onSave` and `fileName` props, and `save` on its `onReady` api, and the Python binding's `save`/`save_path` serialize edited decks instead of raising — `UnsupportedWriteError` is gone.

  Inside an edited paragraph, untouched runs keep their exact source markup; an edit contained in a single source run is rebuilt onto that run's properties, so hyperlinks, strikethrough, and spacing survive it. An edit spanning several source runs rewrites the span from the modeled styling — hyperlink and field bindings inside that span do not survive, which is the known write-back limitation.

- 6c7e94a: A deck snapshot persisted by the previous release opens again. Charts made the stored package a version 2 document, and the version check demanded an exact match, so every version 1 snapshot — every presentation a collaborator had already edited and saved — came back as `unsupported deck schema version` and could not be reopened.

  `open_from_update` now migrates instead of refusing. A version 1 document hydrates, its stored package is read back and rewritten in the current shape, and the document is stamped version 2, so the next snapshot the session writes is a version 2 one and the upgrade happens once. Nothing else in the document changes: the slide order, slide, shape and story containers were already identical between the two versions, and the only difference was the chart list the stored package gained. That list is optional when reading, so a package written before charts existed loads with none rather than failing on a missing field. Two clients opening the same old snapshot write the same migration and converge.

  A version this build does not know — a document from a newer release, or one whose version is missing or nonsense — is still rejected, and still reported before the stored package is parsed so the version is the error the caller sees.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 5212690: Google Slides-style editor toolbar for the PPTX editor: new-slide split button
  with layout picker, undo/redo, zoom, select and text-box tools, and contextual
  text formatting that also applies to whole shapes on selection. Text formatting
  now spans paragraph boundaries as a single undoable operation, double/triple
  click select word/paragraph, and roundRect corners render circular per the
  OOXML adj value instead of stretching with the shape.
- c134b2f: Collaborative presence: remote collaborators' shape selections render as colored outlines with name flags, with toolbar avatar chips and filmstrip dots showing which slide each peer is viewing.
- b87185f: Shape insertion and styling: a Slides-style shape picker inserts preset
  geometries (rectangles, ellipse, polygons, stars, arrows, chevron) by click
  or drag, and selected shapes get contextual fill, border color, border width,
  and corner-radius controls backed by new undoable, collaboration-native
  addShape/setShapeFill/setShapeStroke/setShapeAdjust engine operations.
