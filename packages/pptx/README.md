# @betteroffice/pptx

Framework-free core for the BetterOffice PPTX editor — the Rust parser, yrs deck
model, slide layout, and display-list engine compiled to WebAssembly, plus the
Canvas2D replay host.

```bash
bun add @betteroffice/pptx
```

Most apps want the turnkey React component in
[`@betteroffice/pptx-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@betteroffice/pptx-react).
Use this package directly to build custom presentation chrome.

## View without loading the editor

The viewer entry point parses and renders slides without constructing a Yrs
document or exporting edit, save, undo, or collaboration methods:

```ts
import {
  analyzeOpenPresentation,
  initWasm,
  openPresentation,
  paintSlide,
  sizeCanvasForSlide,
} from '@betteroffice/pptx/viewer';

await initWasm();
const deck = openPresentation(new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer()), {
  fonts: [{ family: 'My Sans', bytes: fontBytes }],
});
const analysis = analyzeOpenPresentation(deck);
const frame = deck.layoutSlide(0);
sizeCanvasForSlide(canvas, frame, devicePixelRatio);
await paintSlide(canvas.getContext('2d')!, frame, devicePixelRatio);
```

`analysis` reports slide count, titles, shapes, text runs, images, charts,
tables, and notes without parsing the presentation a second time.

Import `@betteroffice/pptx/editor` when the user chooses to edit. The root
entry point remains an editor alias for compatibility.

## Open and edit a slide

```ts
import {
  initWasm,
  openPresentation,
  paintSlide,
  sizeCanvasForSlide,
} from '@betteroffice/pptx/editor';

await initWasm();
const bytes = new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer());
const deck = openPresentation(bytes, {
  fonts: [{ family: 'My Sans', bytes: fontBytes }],
});

const frame = deck.layoutSlide(0);
sizeCanvasForSlide(canvas, frame, devicePixelRatio);
await paintSlide(canvas.getContext('2d')!, frame, devicePixelRatio);
```

`initWasm()` with no argument only works where `fetch` of a same-origin URL works (browsers); Node and SSR must pass the wasm bytes.

All parsing, edits, collaboration state, text shaping, layout, hit-testing, and
display-list emission stay in Rust. The package decodes the typed boundary and
replays the resulting primitives on canvas. Font bytes are supplied by the host
and registered with the Rust shaper through `openPresentation`.

Beyond rendering, `PresentationHandle` covers editing: text
(`insertText` / `deleteText` / `formatText` / `setParagraphAlignment`), slides
(`insertSlide` / `deleteSlide` / `moveSlide`), shapes
(`addTextBox` / `addShape` / `addPicture` / `moveShape` / `resizeShape` /
`setShapeRect`), paint order (`bringShapeToFront` / `sendShapeToBack` /
`bringShapeForward` / `sendShapeBackward`), comments
(`addComment` / `replyToComment` / `setCommentStatus` / `removeComment`),
`hitTest`, undo/redo, and `save()`, which serializes the deck back to `.pptx`
bytes with edits applied — untouched slides keep their exact source part bytes.
`addPicture` accepts common raster/vector MIME types (PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP,
TIFF, WebP, SVG) up to 8 MiB, rejecting anything past either limit before it
reaches the deck.

## Agent proposals

Stage a group of edits, inspect it, then accept or reject it:

```ts
const slide = deck.snapshot().slides[0];
const shape = slide.shapes.find((shape) => shape.textStories.length > 0)!;
const story = shape.textStories[0];
const proposal = deck.propose('editor-agent', 'Make the title concise', [{
  type: 'replaceText',
  storyId: story.id,
  start: 0,
  end: story.paragraphs[0].runs.reduce((length, run) => length + run.text.length, 0),
  text: 'A clear title',
}]);

const preview = deck.previewProposal(proposal.id);
const proposedSlide = deck.layoutProposalSlide(proposal.id, 0);
const diff = deck.layoutProposalDiffSlide(proposal.id, 0);
await paintSlide(canvas.getContext('2d')!, diff.frame, devicePixelRatio, 1, {
  textChanges: diff.textChanges,
});
deck.acceptProposal(proposal.id);
deck.undo();
```

`listProposals()` returns agent attribution, notes, edits, before/after targets,
and current `staleTargets`. `previewProposal()` and `layoutProposalSlide()` replay
against the current deck without changing it. `rejectProposal(id)` removes a
pending group. Acceptance applies the whole group in one undo step and emits
one local update; an invalid edit prevents the entire group from being staged
or accepted.

`layoutProposalDiffSlide()` lays removed and inserted text out together, keeping
unchanged words as context and retaining fonts and emphasis. Pass its
`textChanges` to `paintSlide()` for red highlights and strikethrough on deletions,
and green highlights and underlines on insertions. Its snapshot and UTF-16
ranges describe a temporary review layout; use the live handle for editing and
the ordinary proposed layout for the result after acceptance. Review rendering
does not replace the live hit-test state or add markup to saved presentations.

Supported edits replace text within one paragraph, format text, align paragraphs,
set shape geometry/fill/stroke/adjustments, and replace speaker notes. Text offsets
use UTF-16 and shape coordinates use EMU. Text replacement inherits the style at
its start unless `style` is supplied. Edits run in order, so later text offsets
refer to the result of earlier edits in the group.

Changing a targeted shape or its notes makes acceptance throw `StaleProposalError`
with target IDs. Review a fresh preview before calling
`acceptProposal(id, { force: true })`; force still validates targets and ranges.
Unrelated peer edits survive acceptance and Undo. Up to 64 proposals, each with
1–256 edits, may be pending.

Pending proposals belong to this open session: they are excluded from PPTX
exports and collaboration updates. Accepted edits save and sync normally.
`isProposalsAvailable()` supports hosts that load an older WASM build.

## Comments

PowerPoint has two comment systems and a file only ever uses one: `legacy`
reads in every version of PowerPoint plus LibreOffice and Google Slides, while
`modern` carries replies and a resolved state but only shows in PowerPoint 365.
A deck commits to one at its first comment, so `setCommentFlavor` only works
while `comments()` is empty, and `replyToComment` / `setCommentStatus` throw on
a legacy deck.

Saving patches existing comment XML, preserving identities, formatting, task
metadata, anchors and unknown fields. Unedited parts remain byte-identical.
Removing a thread removes its known replies; a concurrent reply survives as a
new root if its parent was deleted.

```ts
deck.addComment(deck.snapshot().slides[0].id, {
  author: 'Ada Lovelace',
  initials: 'AL',
  text: 'Tighten this claim.',
  created: new Date().toISOString(),
  xEmu: 1_828_800,
  yEmu: 914_400,
});
```

Positions are EMU, like every other coordinate. `created` is supplied by the
caller rather than read from a clock, so peers replaying the same edits
converge.

## Collaboration

`PresentationHandle` is a collaboration replica. Pair it with
`CollaborationProvider` and a transport implementing the small
`CollaborationTransport` interface. The provider speaks the standard Yjs sync-v1
wire protocol, performs state-vector handshakes, forwards only local updates,
and bounds frames and pending backpressure bytes.

```ts
import { CollaborationProvider } from '@betteroffice/pptx';

const provider = new CollaborationProvider(deck, transport, {
  user: { name: "Ada" }, // identity for this peer's presence chip
});
deck.onUpdate((_update, origin) => {
  if (origin === 'remote') repaint();
});
provider.connect();
```

## Development

The generated `.wasm` binary is intentionally not committed. From the repository
root, install `wasm-pack` 0.15.0 and `binaryen`, then run
`bun scripts/build-pptx-wasm.ts`.
Package builds copy the binary into `dist/generated`.

### Operation profiles

`layoutSlideProfiled` returns `{ layout, profile }` with scope, layout, and
serialization durations in milliseconds. Profiled mutation methods such as
`insertTextProfiled` and `addTextBoxProfiled` return `{ receipt, profile }`;
`undoProfiled` reports undo, snapshot, and serialization timings. These methods
share the normal operations and add stage timing. See the
[corpus and browser tests](../../e2e/README.md) for usage and timing limits.

## Host undo and comment controls

`handle.setUndoCaptureMode('manual')` groups tracked local edits across pauses
and operation types until `handle.addUndoBoundary()`. The getter
`handle.undoCaptureMode()` returns `'auto'` or `'manual'`. Changing modes closes
the current group and preserves history; setting the same mode is a no-op.
Auto preserves the existing policy (500 ms capture on native targets, separate
transactions in the browser). Remote and agent origins remain outside local
undo. These controls group history; they do not make edits atomic.

`handle.setCommentPosition(commentId, { xEmu, yEmu })` moves an existing root
comment on its current slide, preserving identity, author, text, replies, and
resolution state through collaboration, undo/redo, and export. Coordinates must
be safe integers in EMU. Replies share their root's position. Unknown IDs,
reply IDs, and invalid coordinates fail before mutation. Legacy PowerPoint
comments quantize exported positions to master units (1/576 inch).
