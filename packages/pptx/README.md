# @betteroffice/pptx

Framework-free core for the BetterOffice PPTX editor — the Rust parser, yrs deck
model, slide layout, and display-list engine compiled to WebAssembly, plus the
Canvas2D replay host.

> **Early (`0.0.x`).** The core surfaces — opening/saving documents, the editor
> components, collaboration — are settling and unlikely to change shape. Smaller
> APIs may still move between releases; breaking changes are always listed in
> the changelog.

```bash
bun add @betteroffice/pptx
```

Most apps want the turnkey React component in
[`@betteroffice/pptx-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@betteroffice/pptx-react).
Use this package directly to build custom presentation chrome.

## View without loading the editor

The viewer entry point parses and renders slides without constructing a Yrs
document or exporting edit, save, undo, or collaboration methods:

```ts
import {
  analyzeOpenPresentation,
  initWasm,
  openPresentation,
  paintSlide,
  sizeCanvasForSlide,
} from '@betteroffice/pptx/viewer';

await initWasm();
const deck = openPresentation(new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer()), {
  fonts: [{ family: 'My Sans', bytes: fontBytes }],
});
const analysis = analyzeOpenPresentation(deck);
const frame = deck.layoutSlide(0);
sizeCanvasForSlide(canvas, frame, devicePixelRatio);
await paintSlide(canvas.getContext('2d')!, frame, devicePixelRatio);
```

`analysis` reports slide count, titles, shapes, text runs, images, charts,
tables, and notes without parsing the presentation a second time.

Import `@betteroffice/pptx/editor` when the user chooses to edit. The root
entry point remains an editor alias for compatibility.

## Open and edit a slide

```ts
import {
  initWasm,
  openPresentation,
  paintSlide,
  sizeCanvasForSlide,
} from '@betteroffice/pptx/editor';

await initWasm();
const bytes = new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer());
const deck = openPresentation(bytes, {
  fonts: [{ family: 'My Sans', bytes: fontBytes }],
});

const frame = deck.layoutSlide(0);
sizeCanvasForSlide(canvas, frame, devicePixelRatio);
await paintSlide(canvas.getContext('2d')!, frame, devicePixelRatio);
```

All parsing, edits, collaboration state, text shaping, layout, hit-testing, and
display-list emission stay in Rust. The package decodes the typed boundary and
replays the resulting primitives on canvas. Font bytes are supplied by the host
and registered with the Rust shaper through `openPresentation`.

Beyond rendering, `PresentationHandle` covers editing: text
(`insertText` / `deleteText` / `formatText`), slides
(`insertSlide` / `deleteSlide` / `moveSlide`), shapes
(`addTextBox` / `moveShape` / `resizeShape`), `hitTest`, undo/redo, and
`save()`, which serializes the deck back to `.pptx` bytes with edits applied —
untouched slides keep their exact source part bytes.

## Collaboration

`PresentationHandle` is a collaboration replica. Pair it with
`CollaborationProvider` and a transport implementing the small
`CollaborationTransport` interface. The provider speaks the standard Yjs sync-v1
wire protocol, performs state-vector handshakes, forwards only local updates,
and bounds frames and pending backpressure bytes.

```ts
import { CollaborationProvider } from '@betteroffice/pptx';

const provider = new CollaborationProvider(deck, transport, {
  user: { name: "Ada" }, // identity for this peer's presence chip
});
deck.onUpdate((_update, origin) => {
  if (origin === 'remote') repaint();
});
provider.connect();
```

## Development

The generated `.wasm` binary is intentionally not committed. From the repository
root, install `wasm-pack` 0.15.0 and `binaryen`, then run
`bun scripts/build-pptx-wasm.ts`.
Package builds copy the binary into `dist/generated`.
