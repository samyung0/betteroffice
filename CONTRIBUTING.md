# Contributing to BetterOffice

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.0+)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable, with `rustfmt` and `clippy`)
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)
- [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) 0.15.0
  (`cargo install wasm-pack --version 0.15.0 --locked`)
- [`binaryen`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) for `wasm-opt`
  (`brew install binaryen` / `apt-get install binaryen`)

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/openooxml/betteroffice.git
cd betteroffice

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the editor playground (builds the wasm bundles on first run)
bun run dev:demo

# Start the betteroffice.dev site (no wasm needed)
bun run dev

# Start the documentation site
bun run dev:docs
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# TypeScript (`bun run test` builds the xlsx and docx wasm itself)
bun run typecheck
bun run test

# Rust engines (fmt + clippy with -D warnings + tests)
bun run rust:check

# End-to-end scenarios on pinned corpus documents, every operation timed
# Requires the pinned corpus and locally built Python bindings.
bun e2e/python-env.ts
bun run test:e2e

# Headless Chromium: real DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX editor interactions.
bunx playwright install chromium
bun run test:e2e:browser
```

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributors are required to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md). The CLA assistant will leave a comment on your first pull request with signing instructions — one short comment, about 30 seconds. That signature covers all of your future contributions. Contributing as part of your job? Your employer can sign the [Corporate CLA](CCLA.md) instead; the bot comment explains both paths.

## Making Changes

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. **Read the code** before modifying it — match the conventions you find
3. **Make your changes** — keep them focused and minimal
4. **Add/update tests** for your changes
5. **Verify** everything works:
   ```bash
   bun run typecheck && bun run test && bun run rust:check
   ```
6. **Submit a PR** against `main` — the CLA bot will prompt you on your first one
